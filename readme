I have long commutes, hence this scrappy code.


Not sure how useful this will be for other astro-ph aficionados. However, if you can tolerate listening to nonsense like ``h underscore zero tension'' all day without getting sleepy, you are welcome to give it a shot. Even better if Astronomers could divert some of their astronomical road rage to improving the code.


I claim no responsibility if you smash into the oncoming traffic after hearing that your paper got scooped.


Drive safe, my fellow Astronomers.
