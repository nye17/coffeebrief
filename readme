I have long commutes, hence this scrappy code. I am not sure how useful this will be
for other astro-ph aficionados. However, if you can tolerate
listening to nonsense like ``h underscore zero tension'' all day without getting into sleep, you are welcome
to give it a shot.


I claim no responsibility if you smash into the car in front after hearing that your
paper got scooped.


Safe driving.
